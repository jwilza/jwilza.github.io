        <p> I'm a <b>UX Designer</b> and <b>Visual Designer</b> <br> from Atlanta, GA </p>
        <p> Being an artist by trade has allowed me to create cutting edge, one-of-a-kind designs. The ability to
          captivate a user at a single glance expands far beyond what the eyes can see. Building a connection is the core
          to understanding the user. Having worked as a nurse, I have a passion for human-centered solutions. By having
          the user at the center of my design process, unique combination of structures that are simple, clean, engaging,
          and intuitive come to life.
          <br><br>When I’m not sketching an idea or working on a project, you’ll find me painting or playing with my toddler.
