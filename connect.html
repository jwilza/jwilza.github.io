                <p class="md">I played the role of the UX Researcher and UX Designer during the development of Connect. To resolve the problem with accessing stored files, files are saved automatically on this cloud platform. Once saved, users have the option to share their documents with other people and decide the capacity in which to involve others: viewer, commenter, or editor. Through the sharing of files, users are given the opportunity to collaborate with others in real-time. Now it’s time to reflect on the process of how Connect was put together over the course of three weeks.</p>

                    <p class="md">After reviewing the survey results, I conducted a competitive analysis on the top three cloud storage platforms used among my survey participants: Google Drive, Dropbox, and Apple iCloud.</p>
                    <p class="md">Google launched Google Drive back in 2012. This cloud storage platform offers the highest free storage space of 15 GB. However, the free storage space includes email received in the Google account.</p>
                    <p class="md">Dropbox is older than both Google Drive and Apple iCloud; it was launched in 2008. Users can share links with other people and add expiration dates and passwords for extra protection. Unfortunately, users with a basic plan do not have access to all these features.</p>
                    <p class="md">Apple iCloud was launched in 2011. It’s known for having top notch security. Its main weakness is that it has a limited audience because only Apple users can access Apple iCloud.</p>

                    <p class="md">Although I anticipated the onboarding task to be the easiest of the three tasks, I was surprised to observe the users struggling to find the right button to click on the landing page. The “Try it free” button was placed on the landing page as a way to motivate new users to sign up for a free account. However, this button did not indicate that it was the sign up button. Instead, it caused a lot of confusion, and the participants clicked on different options before selecting the correct button.</p>

                        <li>“Try it free” button was changed to “Sign Up Free.”</li>

                <p class="md">The prime mission of this cloud storage platform is to create a space where people can stay connected, help one another, and thrive together. For example, users can connect to family and friends by sharing pictures. Users can also connect with their co-workers by collaborating on projects. I aimed for a simple brand name, so I looked for a self-explanatory title. Once I established the title of the cloud platform, I started to design a logo. It was important to create a simple brand that reflected the idea of connection via sharing files, pictures, and videos. I started with a few logo sketches.</p>
                <p class="md">As time went on, I slowly refined the brand into its final composition.</p>

                <p class="md">After finalizing the logo, I began to work on the moodboard, which helped me to establish the color palette for this platform. The original moodboard consisted of three primary colors: red, yellow, and blue. However, after constructing the landing page with the primary colors, it became apparent that the colors were not simple to work with afterall. Those colors were very bold and may have caused heightened senses for some users, such as danger due to the red color.</p>

                <p class="md">The Connect logo is available in two configurations: black and white. On a light background, the black version must be used and vice versa. The whitespace around the Connect logo should always be equal to the circles within the mark. The font Questrial resembles the quality of simplicity because there is no ear, tail, and link noted, which makes the brand easy to read. In contrast, Oleo Script is a bit more complex and quirky. This idea that opposites attract and that no two individuals are the same make this combination beautiful.</p>

                <p class="md">After finalizing the clickable prototype, I conducted another usability test with three participants. The same tasks used in the first usability test were performed by three different users. Although I anticipated all three tasks to be completed without any trouble, the task of moving a file into a folder was not completed successfully on the first attempt. Two out of the three users tried to drag “File 1” into “Folder 1.” Nevertheless, all users selected the “Move Now” button once they realized the dragging method had failed.</p>

                <p class="md">The dragging feature is a method that many users like to use because it’s quick and easy. Also many are now accustomed to this option. When designing the process of completing certain tasks I must do my best to incorporate the dragging feature or the right click method whenever possible. Although I may not be able to test these methods via Figma, I will inform the Web Developer team of these important designs.</p>

    <!-- CONCLUSION -->

                <h2 class="cs-title">Conclusion</h2>
                <p class="md">The big takeaway lesson I learned while working on this project; is the importance of non-verbal cues. Although the users never complained about the use of primary colors on the landing page, I found the facial expressions and confusion that conveyed their difficulties with navigating the page.</p>
                <p class="md">Therefore, as an UX Designer, it is important that I avoid getting attached to a design because if the user does not respond positively to my work, I must not hesitate to change and redesign it.</p>
                <p class="md">In my case, redesigning the landing page and incorporating the new color palette felt like a step backward, and it took a lot of work but in the end, it was worth every second. When I allow the research and results I collected from different testing to dictate the direction of my design, I will design a stronger and more well-built end product.</p>
                <p class="md">Modifying the design according to the responses of potential users is inspiring. This scope of practice challenges me to be more observant and intentional, while being a risk-taker who is not afraid to think outside of the box.</p>
