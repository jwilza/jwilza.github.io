                <p class="md">I really enjoyed working on this project because it involved designing a platform that could potentially help mend broken bridges caused by the coronavirus pandemic. I wanted to make sure the site was feasible and versatile for both professional and personal use. Prior to sketching ideas, I devoted a good chunk of my time to researching current competitors and users. Once I learned about them, I began to flesh out the different wireframes and mockups for The Loft. Two rounds of usability testings were performed in this project, allowing potential users to interact with the design. The results gathered were used to modify the design and ultimately improve the overall function of The Loft. Now let me walk you through the different stages.</p>

                    <p class="md">Before I could start the design process, I needed to collect some valuable data via user surveys. Twenty-one individuals participated in this exercise. The data collected allowed me to evaluate whether or not there is a true need for a video conferencing platform, and what ways people care to use it. I anticipated the top two leading video conferencing platforms would have been Zoom and FaceTime. However, the top two frequently used video conferencing platforms among the 21 participants were Zoom (100%) and Skype (76.2%). I predicted Zoom would be the main video conferencing platform used for personal use and Cisco WebEx would be the main platform used for work. However, Zoom turned out to be the leading video conferencing platform for both personal use and work. There has been an increase in the use of video conferencing platforms since the rise of COVID-19, which supports the growing need for a video conferencing platform such as The Loft.</p>

                <div>
                    <p class="md">Once I finished the digital wireframes in Figma, I made a clickable prototype that would later be used to perform usability testing on three potential users. Each participant was asked to complete the 5 tasks listed below. The tasks chosen were based upon the survey participants' response towards the top features they used in video conferencing platforms.</p>

                    <ol class="cs-list">
                        <li>Sign up for an account using an email address and a password.</li>
                        <li>Log out from the homepage and then log in using email address and password.</li>
                        <li>Schedule a meeting using the participant’s email address.</li>
                        <li>Mute yourself (name: Derrick Brown) during a conference call.</li>
                        <li>Share screen 2 with colleagues.</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <p class="md">In the beginning, I predicted all three participants would have difficulties with scheduling a meeting simply because there are several buttons on the dashboard. However, that was not the case. In fact, all three participants successfully completed task 1, 2, 3, & 5 on their first try. For task 4 (mute yourself), one participant clicked the microphone, which is found in the right sidebar beside the name Derrick Brown, instead of selecting the microphone button located at the bottom. This was no mistake of the participant, but rather of the designer. I had forgotten to include this route when producing the clickable prototype.</p>

                <p class="md">Prior to producing the high-fidelity mockup, there needed to be a clear understanding of the brand and its overall mission. The purpose of The Loft is to foster a space where relationships can be formed and strengthened. Whether for professional or personal use, this video conferencing platform needed to be a space where individuals feel comfortable and secure. For this reason, the color palette consisted of vibrants colors such as mustard-gold color and turquoise and also featured a wide range of gray tones. Below is the production of the final moodboard.</p>
                <p class="md">In addition to the color palette, I had to select two fonts that not only worked harmoniously together but also matched with this project. Reem Kufi was selected as the brand’s primary typeface, and Open Sans was the complimentary typeface used to create contrast and visual hierarchy.</p>
                <p class="md">All the vital information pertaining to the logo and the overall brand was outlined in the style guide.</p>

                <p class="md">Another group of individuals participated in the second round of usability testing. All three potential users completed the five tasks successfully. However, two out of the three participants failed to correctly answer what the site was about within the first 30 seconds of being on the landing page. The participants focused first on pictures before looking at the words on a page, which explains why many designers place words on top of an image. This method is very effective because it forces the users to direct their attention to the text on a page.</p>

                <p class="md">Though it would be nice to design a platform that surpasses the current competitors. The most important objective is to create something useful and meaningful. I hope to leave a mark and make a difference in the lives of others.</p>
                <p class="md">There’s nothing more rewarding than knowing that via a platform such as The Loft, people are able to reconnect with family and friends during a pandemic where social distancing is crucial.</p>
