            These are extraordinary times, and countries from all around the world are struggling to keep their economy
            from crashing while maintaining the health and safety of their fellow citizens. A new video conferencing
            platform called The Loft has been created to bridge the gap caused by the pandemic.

          <h3 class="text-gold font-30">Objective:</h3>
          <p>
            Creating a desktop site for a video conferencing platform where meetings and virtual functions can be
            organized and managed with well-established features.

        <p class="pb-45">
          I really enjoyed working on this project because it involved designing a platform that could potentially help
          mend broken bridges caused by the coronavirus pandemic. I wanted to make sure the site was feasible and
          versatile for both professional and personal use. Prior to sketching ideas, I devoted a good chunk of my time
          to researching current competitors and users. Once I learned about them, I began to flesh out the different
          wireframes and mockups for The Loft. Two rounds of usability testings were performed in this project, allowing
          potential users to interact with the design. The results gathered were used to modify the design and
          ultimately improve the overall function of The Loft. Now let me walk you through the different stages.

        <h2 class="sub-header text-gold">User Surveys</h2>
        <p>
          Before I could start the design process, I needed to collect some valuable data via user surveys. Twenty-one
          individuals participated in this exercise. The data collected allowed me to evaluate whether or not there is a
          true need for a video conferencing platform, and what ways people care to use it. I anticipated the top two
          leading video conferencing platforms would have been Zoom and FaceTime. However, the top two frequently used
          video conferencing platforms among the 21 participants were Zoom (100%) and Skype (76.2%). I predicted Zoom
          would be the main video conferencing platform used for personal use and Cisco WebEx would be the main platform
          used for work. However, Zoom turned out to be the leading video conferencing platform for both personal use
          and work. As expected, there has been an increase in the use of video conferencing platforms since the rise of
          COVID-19, which supports the growing need for a video conferencing platform such as The Loft.

        <ul>
          <li>
            Before the start of COVID-19, roughly 24% of participants used video conferencing platforms for more than
            an hour.
          </li>
          <li>
            After the rise of COVID-19, roughly 67% of participants use video conferencing platforms for more than an
            hour.
          </li>
          <li>The top 3 features: sharing screens (76.2%), mute feature (52.4%), turn off camera (52.4%).</li>
          <li>The top 3 video conferencing platforms are Zoom, Skype, and Google Hangouts.</li>
          <li>100% of my participants do not pay a monthly fee to use their video conferencing platform.</li>
          <li>71.4% of participants use Zoom and 14.3% of participants use Skype for personal use.</li>
          <li>52.4% of participants use Zoom and 19% of participants use Cisco WebEx/Appear.in at work.</li>
          <li>95.2% of participants use a laptop to access a video conferencing platform.</li>

            Users value free storage space on the cloud platform. They mostly use the platform for personal use and/or
            work. Many users share pictures and documents with other people through cloud platforms.

          Next, I conducted a competitive analysis on the three most popular video conferencing platforms among the
          survey participants: Zoom, Skype, and Google Hangouts. If I had more time, I would have included at least two
          more competitors to the list. Since I use a few of these platforms myself, I was familiar with how they
          typically work. However, I wish I also had more time to navigate on other video conferencing sites to see how
          each organized data on a page.

            In the beginning, I predicted all three participants would have difficulties with scheduling a meeting
            simply because there are several buttons on the dashboard. However, that was not the case. In fact, all
            three participants successfully completed task 1, 2, 3, & 5 on their first try. For task 4 (mute yourself),
            one participant clicked the microphone, which is found in the right sidebar beside the name Derrick Brown,
            instead of selecting the microphone button located at the bottom. This was no mistake of the participant,
            but rather of the designer. I had forgotten to include this route when producing the clickable prototype.

          Prior to producing the high-fidelity mockup, there needed to be a clear understanding of the brand and its
          overall mission. The purpose of The Loft is to foster a space where relationships can be formed and
          strengthened. Whether for professional or personal use, this video conferencing platform needed to be a space
          where individuals feel comfortable and secure. For this reason, the color palette consisted of vibrants colors
          such as mustard-gold color and turquoise and also featured a wide range of gray tones. Below is the production
          of the final moodboard.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In addition to the color palette, I had to select two fonts that not only worked harmoniously together but
          also matched with this project. Reem Kufi was selected as the brandâ€™s primary typeface, and Open Sans was the
          complimentary typeface used to create contrast and visual hierarchy.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          All the vital information pertaining to the logo and the overall brand was outlined in the style guide.

          well. After designing the high-fidelity mockup, I constructed the clickable prototype.

            Another group of individuals participated in the second round of usability testing. All three potential
            users completed the five tasks successfully. However, two out of the three participants failed to correctly
            answer what the site was about within the first 30 seconds of being on the landing page. The participants
            focused first on pictures before looking at the words on a page, which explains why many designers place
            words on top of an image. This method is very effective because it forces the users to direct their
            attention to the text on a page.

        <p>
          Though it would be nice to design a platform that surpasses the current competitors. The most important
          objective is to create something useful and meaningful. I hope to leave a mark and make a difference in the
          lives of others.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thereâ€™s nothing more rewarding than knowing that via a platform such as The Loft, people are
          able to reconnect with family and friends during a pandemic where social distancing is crucial.
