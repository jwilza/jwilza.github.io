        <p class="pb-45">
          I really enjoyed working on this project because it involved designing a platform that could potentially help
          mend broken bridges caused by the coronavirus pandemic. I wanted to make sure the site was feasible and
          versatile, making it useful to both business owners and the overall population. Prior to sketching ideas, I
          devoted a good chunk of my time to research. Once I learned about the current competitors and users, I began
          to flesh out the different wireframes for The Loft. Then conducted usability testings that would allow
          potential users to interact with the design. The results collected were then used to modify the design, and
          ultimately improve the overall function of The Loft. Let me walk you through the different stages.

        <h2 class="sub-header text-gold">User Surveys</h2>
        <p>
          Before I could start the design process, I needed to collect some valuable data via user surveys. Twenty-one
          individuals participated in this exercise. The data collected allowed me to evaluate whether or not there
          truly is a need for a video conferencing platform, and in what ways people care to use it. I anticipated the
          top two leading video conferencing platforms would have been Zoom and FaceTime. Unfortunately, the top two
          frequently used video conferencing platforms among the 21 participants were Zoom (100%) and Skype (76.2%). I
          predicted Zoom would be the main video conferencing platform used for personal use and the Cisco WebEx would
          be the main platform used for work. However, Zoom turned out to be the leading video conferencing platform for
          both personal use and work. As expected, there has been an increase in the use of video conferencing platforms
          since the rise of Covid-19, which supports the growing need for a video conferencing platform such as The
          Loft.

            an hour.</li>
          <li> After the rise of Covid-19, roughly 67% of participants use video conferencing platforms for more than an

            Users value free storage space on the cloud platform. They mostly use the platform for personal use and/or
            work. Many users share pictures and documents with other people through cloud platforms.

          Next, I conducted a competitive analysis on the three most popular video conferencing platforms among the
          survey participants: Zoom, Skype, and Google Hangouts.

        <p class="pb-15">
          If I had more time, I would have included at least two

            In the beginning, I predicted the participants would have difficulties with scheduling a meeting. However,
            that was not the case. In fact, task 1,2,3,& 5 were completed successfully on the first try. On task 4, one
            participant clicked the microphone found in the right sidebar beside the name Derrick Brown instead of
            selecting the microphone button located at the bottom. This was no mistake of the participants but rather
            the designer.

            Although I anticipated the onboarding task to be the easiest of the three tasks, I was surprised to
            observe the users struggling to find the right button to click on the landing page. The “Try it free”
            button was placed on the landing page as a way to motivate new users to sign up for a free account.
            However, this button did not indicate that it was the sign up button. Instead, it caused a lot of
            confusion, and the participants clicked on different options before selecting the correct button.

        <p>
          The prime mission of this cloud storage platform is to create a space where people can stay connected, help
          one another, and thrive together. For example, users can connect to family and friends by sharing pictures.
          Users can also connect with their co-workers by collaborating on projects. I aimed for a simple brand name,
          so I looked for a self-explanatory title. Once I established the title of the cloud platform, I started to
          design a logo. It was important to create a simple brand that reflected the idea of connection via sharing
          files, pictures, and videos. I started with a few logo sketches.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>As time went on, I slowly refined the brand into its final composition.</p>

          After finalizing the logo, I began to work on the moodboard, which helped me to establish the color palette
          for this platform. The original moodboard consisted of three primary colors: red, yellow, and blue. However,
          after constructing the landing page with the primary colors, it became apparent that the colors were not
          simple to work with afterall. Those colors were very bold and may have caused heightened senses for some
          users, such as danger due to the red color.

          The Connect logo is available in two configurations: black and white. On a light background, the black
          version must be used and vice versa. The whitespace around the Connect logo should always be equal to the
          circles within the mark. The font Questrial resembles the quality of simplicity because there is no ear,
          tail, and link noted, which makes the brand easy to read. In contrast, Oleo Script is a bit more complex
          and quirky. This idea that opposites attract and that no two individuals are the same make this
          combination beautiful.

          The “Sign Up Free” button was used on the landing page instead of the original “Try it free” button. By

      <p>
        After finalizing the clickable prototype, I conducted another usability test with three participants. The
        same tasks used in the first usability test were performed by three different users. Although I anticipated
        all three tasks to be completed without any trouble, the task of moving a file into a folder was not
        completed successfully on the first attempt. Two out of the three users tried to drag “File 1” into “Folder
        1.” Nevertheless, all users selected the “Move Now” button once they realized the dragging method had
        failed.

            The dragging feature is a method that many users like to use because it’s quick and easy. Also many are
            now accustomed to this option. When designing the process of completing certain tasks I must do my best
            to incorporate the dragging feature or the right click method whenever possible. Although I may not be
            able to test these methods via Figma, I will inform the Web Developer team of these important designs.
