              need to collaborate and work remotely. Connect is a new innovative

          <p>
            I played the role of the UX Researcher and UX Designer during the
            development of Connect. To resolve the problem with accessing stored
            files, files are saved automatically on this cloud platform. Once
            saved, users have the option to share their documents with other
            people and decide the capacity in which to involve others: viewer,
            commenter, or editor. Through the sharing of files, users are given
            the opportunity to collaborate with others in real-time. Now it’s
            time to reflect on the process of how Connect was put together over
            the course of three weeks.

        <p>
          After reviewing the survey results, I conducted a competitive analysis
          on the top three cloud storage platforms used among my survey

            Google launched Google Drive back in 2012. This cloud storage
            platform offers the highest free storage space of 15 GB. However,
            the free storage space includes email received in the Google
            account.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dropbox is older than both Google Drive and Apple iCloud; it was
            launched in 2008. Users can share links with other people and add
            expiration dates and passwords for extra protection. Unfortunately,
            users with a basic plan do not have access to all these features.
          </p>
          <p>
            Apple iCloud was launched in 2011. It’s known for having top notch
            security. Its main weakness is that it has a limited audience
            because only Apple users can access Apple iCloud.

                Once I finalized the clickable prototype, I conducted a
                usability test with three participants. The test focused on
                three specific tasks, which I chose from the six highly
                important tasks.
              </p>
              <div>
                <p>1.) Sign up for a new account</p>
                <p>2.) Move “File 1” to “Folder 1”</p>
                <p>3.) Upload a file called “Document 1”</p>
              </div>
            </div>

          <section class="col-6 justify-center-column">
            <p>
              Only the uploading task was completed successfully by all three
              users. User 3 recommended including a confirmation message after
              completing the uploading task. For onboarding, none of the
              participants clicked the “Try it free” button on their first
              attempt. Two out of the three participants found the second screen
              for the onboarding process confusing because they gravitated
              towards the log-in section instead of the sign-up section, which
              was found on the left side of the page.

              Although I anticipated the onboarding task to be the easiest of
              the three tasks, I was surprised to observe the users struggling
              to find the right button to click on the landing page. The “Try it
              free” button was placed on the landing page as a way to motivate
              new users to sign up for a free account. However, this button did
              not indicate that it was the sign up button. Instead, it caused a
              lot of confusion, and the participants clicked on different
              options before selecting the correct button.

        <p>
          The prime mission of this cloud storage platform is to create a space
          where people can stay connected, help one another, and thrive
          together. For example, users can connect to family and friends by
          sharing pictures. Users can also connect with their co-workers by
          collaborating on projects. I aimed for a simple brand name, so I
          looked for a self-explanatory title. Once I established the title of
          the cloud platform, I started to design a logo. It was important to
          create a simple brand that reflected the idea of connection via
          sharing files, pictures, and videos. I started with a few logo
          sketches.
        </p>
        <br />
        <img alt="connect-logo" src="./images/connectlogo.png" />
        <br />
        <p>
          As time went on, I slowly refined the brand into its final
          composition.

        <p>
          After finalizing the logo, I began to work on the moodboard, which
          helped me to establish the color palette for this platform. The
          original moodboard consisted of three primary colors: red, yellow, and
          blue. However, after constructing the landing page with the primary
          colors, it became apparent that the colors were not simple to work
          with afterall. Those colors were very bold and may have caused
          heightened senses for some users, such as danger due to the red color.
        </p>

            <p>
              Since using primary colors did not illustrate the idea of
              simplicity, I transitioned to using muted colors to create a sense
              of calmness. By creating a sense of calmness and relaxation, users
              will want to spend more time on the cloud storage platform,
              especially since the hope is to have users collaborate on projects
              via this site.

              The Connect logo is available in two configurations: black and
              white. On a light background, the black version must be used and
              vice versa. The whitespace around the Connect logo should always
              be equal to the circles within the mark. The font Questrial
              resembles the quality of simplicity because there is no ear, tail,
              and link noted, which makes the brand easy to read. In contrast,
              Oleo Script is a bit more complex and quirky. This idea that
              opposites attract and that no two individuals are the same make
              this combination beautiful.

            After finalizing the clickable prototype, I conducted another
            usability test with three participants. The same tasks used in the
            first usability test were performed by three different users.
            Although I anticipated all three tasks to be completed without any
            trouble, the task of moving a file into a folder was not completed
            successfully on the first attempt. Two out of the three users tried
            to drag “File 1” into “Folder 1.” Nevertheless, all users selected
            the “Move Now” button once they realized the dragging method had
            failed.

                The dragging feature is a method that many users like to use
                because it’s quick and easy. Also many are now accustomed to
                this option. When designing the process of completing certain
                tasks I must do my best to incorporate the dragging feature or
                the right click method whenever possible. Although I may not be
                able to test these methods via Figma, I will inform the Web
                Developer team of these important designs.

              The big takeaway lesson I learned while working on this project;
              is the importance of non-verbal cues. Although the users never
              complained about the use of primary colors on the landing page, I
              found the facial expressions and confusion that conveyed their
              difficulties with navigating the page.
            </p>
            <p>
              Therefore, as an UX Designer, it is important that I avoid getting
              attached to a design because if the user does not respond
              positively to my work, I must not hesitate to change and redesign
              it.
            </p>

          <section class="col-6 justify-center-column">
            <p>
              In my case, redesigning the landing page and incorporating the new
              color palette felt like a step backward, and it took a lot of work
              but in the end, it was worth every second. When I allow the
              research and results I collected from different testing to dictate
              the direction of my design, I will design a stronger and more
              well-built end product.
            </p>
            <p>
              Modifying the design according to the responses of potential users
              is inspiring. This scope of practice challenges me to be more
              observant and intentional, while being a risk-taker who is not
              afraid to think outside of the box.
