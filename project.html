              The cloud storage industry is booming along with the increasing need to collaborate and work remotely.
              Connect is a new innovative cloud platform well suited for storing and sharing data from anywhere in the

            I played the role of the UX Researcher and UX Designer during the development of Connect. To resolve the
            problem with accessing stored files, files are saved automatically on this cloud platform. Once saved, users
            have the option to share their documents with other people and decide the capacity in which to involve
            others: viewer, commenter, or editor. Through the sharing of files, users are given the opportunity to
            collaborate with others in real-time. Now it’s time to reflect on the process of how Connect was put
            together over the course of three weeks.

              Users value free storage space on the cloud platform. They mostly use the platform for personal use and/or
              work. Many users share pictures and documents with other people through cloud platforms.

          <p class="pb-15">
            After reviewing the survey results, I conducted a competitive analysis on the top three cloud storage
            platforms used among my survey participants: Google Drive, Dropbox, and Apple iCloud.
          </p>
          <p class="pb-15">
            Google launched Google Drive back in 2012. This cloud storage platform offers the highest free storage space
            of 15 GB. However, the free storage space includes email received in the Google account.
          </p>
          <p class="pb-15">
            Dropbox is older than both Google Drive and Apple iCloud; it was launched in 2008. Users can share links
            with other people and add expiration dates and passwords for extra protection. Unfortunately, users with a
            basic plan do not have access to all these features.
          </p>
          <p>
            Apple iCloud was launched in 2011. It’s known for having top notch security. Its main weakness is that it
            has a limited audience because only Apple users can access Apple iCloud.

                Once I finalized the clickable prototype, I conducted a usability test with three participants. The test
                focused on three specific tasks, which I chose from the six highly important tasks.
              </p>
              <div>
                <p>1) Sign up for a new account</p>
                <p>2) Move “File 1” to “Folder 1”</p>
                <p>3) Upload a file called “Document 1”</p>
              </div>

              Only the uploading task was completed successfully by all three users. User 3 recommended including a
              confirmation message after completing the uploading task. For onboarding, none of the participants clicked
              the “Try it free” button on their first attempt. Two out of the three participants found the second screen
              for the onboarding process confusing because they gravitated towards the log-in section instead of the
              sign-up section, which was found on the left side of the page.

              Although I anticipated the onboarding task to be the easiest of the three tasks, I was surprised to
              observe the users struggling to find the right button to click on the landing page. The “Try it free”
              button was placed on the landing page as a way to motivate new users to sign up for a free account.
              However, this button did not indicate that it was the sign up button. Instead, it caused a lot of
              confusion, and the participants clicked on different options before selecting the correct button.

            The prime mission of this cloud storage platform is to create a space where people can stay connected, help
            one another, and thrive together. For example, users can connect to family and friends by sharing pictures.
            Users can also connect with their co-workers by collaborating on projects. I aimed for a simple brand name,
            so I looked for a self-explanatory title. Once I established the title of the cloud platform, I started to
            design a logo. It was important to create a simple brand that reflected the idea of connection via sharing
            files, pictures, and videos. I started with a few logo sketches.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>As time went on, I slowly refined the brand into its final composition.</p>

            After finalizing the logo, I began to work on the moodboard, which helped me to establish the color palette
            for this platform. The original moodboard consisted of three primary colors: red, yellow, and blue. However,
            after constructing the landing page with the primary colors, it became apparent that the colors were not
            simple to work with afterall. Those colors were very bold and may have caused heightened senses for some
            users, such as danger due to the red color.

              The Connect logo is available in two configurations: black and white. On a light background, the black
              version must be used and vice versa. The whitespace around the Connect logo should always be equal to the
              circles within the mark. The font Questrial resembles the quality of simplicity because there is no ear,
              tail, and link noted, which makes the brand easy to read. In contrast, Oleo Script is a bit more complex
              and quirky. This idea that opposites attract and that no two individuals are the same make this
              combination beautiful.

            After finalizing the clickable prototype, I conducted another usability test with three participants. The
            same tasks used in the first usability test were performed by three different users. Although I anticipated
            all three tasks to be completed without any trouble, the task of moving a file into a folder was not
            completed successfully on the first attempt. Two out of the three users tried to drag “File 1” into “Folder
            1.” Nevertheless, all users selected the “Move Now” button once they realized the dragging method had
            failed.

                The dragging feature is a method that many users like to use because it’s quick and easy. Also many are
                now accustomed to this option. When designing the process of completing certain tasks I must do my best
                to incorporate the dragging feature or the right click method whenever possible. Although I may not be
                able to test these methods via Figma, I will inform the Web Developer team of these important designs.

            <p>
              The big takeaway lesson I learned while working on this project; is the importance of non-verbal cues.
              Although the users never complained about the use of primary colors on the landing page, I found the
              facial expressions and confusion that conveyed their difficulties with navigating the page.
            </p>
            <p>
              Therefore, as an UX Designer, it is important that I avoid getting attached to a design because if the
              user does not respond positively to my work, I must not hesitate to change and redesign it.
            </p>

          <section class="col-6 justify-center-column">
            <p>
              In my case, redesigning the landing page and incorporating the new color palette felt like a step
              backward, and it took a lot of work but in the end, it was worth every second. When I allow the research
              and results I collected from different testing to dictate the direction of my design, I will design a
              stronger and more well-built end product.
            </p>
            <p>
              Modifying the design according to the responses of potential users is inspiring. This scope of practice
              challenges me to be more observant and intentional, while being a risk-taker who is not afraid to think
              outside of the box.
