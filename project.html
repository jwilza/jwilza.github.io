      <p>
        I played the role of the UX Researcher and UX Designer during the development of Connect. To resolve the problem
        with accessing stored files,
        files are saved automatically on this cloud platform. Once saved, users have the option to share their documents
        with other people and decide
        the capacity in which to involve others: viewer, commenter, or editor. Through the sharing of files, users are
        given the opportunity to collaborate
        with others in real-time. Now it’s time to reflect on the process of how Connect was put together over the
        course of three weeks.

      <p>
        Google launched Google Drive back in 2012. This cloud storage platform offers the highest free storage space of
        15 GB.
        However, the free storage space includes email received in the Google account.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dropbox is older than both Google Drive and Apple iCloud; it was launched in 2008.
        Users can share links with other people and add expiration dates and passwords for extra protection.
        Unfortunately, users with a basic plan do not have access to all these features.
      </p>
      <p>
        Apple iCloud was launched in 2011. It’s known for having top notch security.
        Its main weakness is that it has a limited audience because only Apple users can access Apple iCloud.

          the onboarding process confusing because they gravitated towards the log-in section instead of the sign-up

          However, this button did not indicate that it was the sign up button. Instead, it caused a lot of confusion,
          and the participants clicked on different options

    <h2 class="sub-header purple">Branding</h2>
    <p>
      The prime mission of this cloud storage platform is to create a space where people can stay connected,
      help one another, and thrive together. For example, users can connect to family and friends by sharing pictures.
      Users can also connect with their co-workers by collaborating on projects. I aimed for a simple brand name, so I
      looked for a self-explanatory title.
      Once I established the title of the cloud platform, I started to design a logo. It was important to create a
      simple brand that reflected the idea of
      connection via sharing files, pictures, and videos. I started with a few logo sketches.
    </p>
    <img src="images/Group 11_Connect Logos.png" />

    <p>
      After finalizing the logo, I began to work on the moodboard, which helped me to establish the color palette for
      this platform.
      The original moodboard consisted of three primary colors: red, yellow, and blue. However, after constructing the
      landing page with the primary colors,
      it became apparent that the colors were not simple to work with afterall. Those colors were very bold and may have
      caused heightened senses for some users,
      such as danger due to the red color.

        <p>
          Since using primary colors did not illustrate the idea of simplicity, I transitioned to using muted colors to
          create a sense of calmness.
          By creating a sense of calmness and relaxation, users will want to spend more time on the cloud storage
          platform, especially since the hope is
          to have users collaborate on projects via this site.

          The Connect logo is available in two configurations: black and white. On a light background,
          the black version must be used and vice versa. The whitespace around the Connect logo should always be equal
          to the circles within the mark.
          The font Questrial resembles the quality of simplicity because there is no ear, tail, and link noted, which
          makes the brand easy to read.
          In contrast, Oleo Script is a bit more complex and quirky. This idea that opposites attract and that no two
          individuals are the same make this combination beautiful.

        The information gathered from the style guide allowed me to proceed with the high-fidelity mockup.
        All the changes that were made to the wireframe after the usability testing were incorporated within this stage
        as well.
        After designing the high-fidelity mockup, I constructed the clickable prototype.

            The “Sign Up Free” button was used on the landing page instead of the original “Try it free” button.
            By including the sign up phrase within the button, users could immediately understand that this button was
            involved with the onboarding process.

  <!-- Usability II -->

      <h2 class="sub-header purple">Usability Testing II</h2>
      <p>
        After finalizing the clickable prototype, I conducted another usability test with three participants.
        The same tasks used in the first usability test were performed by three different users.
        Although I anticipated all three tasks to be completed without any trouble, the task of moving a file into a
        folder was not completed
        successfully on the first attempt. Two out of the three users tried to drag “File 1” into “Folder 1.”
        Nevertheless, all users selected the “Move Now” button once they realized the dragging method had failed.

          <p>
            The dragging feature is a method that many users like to use because it’s quick and easy. Also many are now
            accustomed to this option.
            When designing the process of completing certain tasks I must do my best to incorporate the dragging feature
            or the right click method whenever possible.
            Although I may not be able to test these methods via Figma, I will inform the Web Developer team of these
            important designs.

  <!-- Conclusion -->

      <section class="col-6 justify-center-column">
        <p>
          The big takeaway lesson I learned while working on this project; is the importance of non-verbal cues.
          Although the users never complained about the use of primary colors on the landing page, I found the facial
          expressions
          and confusion that conveyed their difficulties with navigating the page.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, as an UX Designer, it is important that I avoid getting attached to a design because if the user
          does not respond positively to my work, I must not hesitate to change and redesign it.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="col-6 justify-center-column">
        <p>
          In my case, redesigning the landing page and incorporating the new color palette felt like a step backward,
          and it took a lot of work but in the end, it was worth every second. When I allow the research and results I
          collected from different testing to dictate the direction of my design, I will design a stronger and more
          well-built end product.
        </p>
        <p>
          Modifying the design according to the responses of potential users is inspiring. This scope of practice
          challenges
          me to be more observant and intentional, while being a risk-taker who is not afraid to think outside of the
          box.
